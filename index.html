                    <p>Hi, I'm <strong>Promise Jacob</strong> — an 18 year old front-end developer from Nigeria on a
                        mission to build a global tech empire starting right here in Africa.</p>
                    <p>Inspired by the journey of innovators like Mark Zuckerberg, I created SkillBridge to empower the
                        next generation of digital builders. I believe that with the right skills and opportunities,
                        young Africans can compete and win on the global tech stage.</p>
                    <p>I’m passionate about creating tools, communities, and products that don’t just make money — but
                        make a difference. SkillBridge is only the beginning.</p>
